#continue button field: eligibility_for_postponement
question: |
  First, let's find out if the property in question is eligible for a Sheriff Sale Postponement.
fields: 
  - "Is the property a homestead?": eligibility_for_postponement
    help: |
      According to Minnesota law, a homestead is any property that:
      (1) is the owner's primary home, and
      (2) is made of 1-4 living units (i.e., a four-plex, triplex, duplex or single family dwelling). You can only postpone the Sheriff sale if the property is a homestead.
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - Yes
      - No

id: sale_date
question: |
  To determine if your deadline has passed, we need to know the date of the Sheriff sale. 
subquestion: |
  The deadline is <b>15 days</b> before the date of the Sheriff sale. If the deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, it moves forward to the next normal business day.
fields:
  - "Sale Date": sale_date
    datatype: date
    help: | 
      The date of the sale is somewhere in the <b>"Notice of Mortgage Foreclosure Sale"</b> you got from the bank (or the bank's attorney).
      
      Read it carefully, and you will find a part that says something like:

      "This property will be sold by the Sheriff at public auction on such and such a date..."
      
      Unfortunately, Notices may differ in how they show the sale date.

question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |  
  1.	Before you print, review your form carefully for any mistakes. If you need to change anything, you will need Microsoft Word. Public computers (like at libraries) have Microsoft Word.
  
  2.	Print your form - but do not sign it yet! Public computers also have pay printers, often for $0.10 per page. Attach a copy of your NOTICE OF MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE SALE.
  
  3.	Get your form Notarized. That means, take it to a person called a "Notary Public," and sign it in front of him or her. After witnessing your signature, the Notary will also sign the form, making it legally valid. You can often find a Notary at the Courthouse or bank. Some charge $1, but not at the Courthouse.
  
  4.	Make three copies of your notarized form (including the NOTICE you attached in Step 2). You should now have a total of four copies. Put one copy with your personal records at home.
  
  5.	Take the original and the remaining two copies to the County Recorder or Registrar of Titles, located at: 

  <b>NOTE:</b> Do not complete Step 5 until after the first publication of the NOTICE (eg., in a newspaper.)

  File the original form there. You will have to pay a recording fee of $50-55. Bring cash or a check. The County Recorder will put the date and filing information on the remaining two copies of your form. You will need them for the next steps.

  <b>TIP:</b> <i>File your papers as soon as you can. Call the Recorder ahead of time to get their office hours, and show up early. It could take over an hour to file your papers. Unexpected problems may cause delays - so do not wait until the last day!</i>

  6.	File one copy with the 	County Sheriff - who is conducting the sale - at this address:

  Some County Sheriffs charge fees to file your form, and others don't.
 
  7.	Deliver one copy to the attorney or law firm conducting the foreclosure. The attorney's name and contact information is on PAGE 2 of your NOTICE OF MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE SALE. Call ahead to see if they want you to send the form via fax, mail, or in-person.

  8.	Finally, follow up the next day with the Sheriff and the foreclosure attorney. Make sure they received your form, and confirm the new sale date.
